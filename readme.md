# Playdate Aseprite Palettes

An aseprite extension giving you palettes representing Playdate's 1-bit colour palette.

This contains two palettes, which are interchangeable with each other:

- Playdate: An emulation of what Playdate's screen looks like under slightly dim lighting conditions (keep in mind that Playdate's screen is highly reflective and contrast will probably vary quite a bit)
- Playdate B+W: Just pure black and white.

The files in this repo:

- /src: The files I used to make it.
- /playdate-palettes.zip: Use this to import into Aseprite!

[This guide](https://aseprite.org/docs/extensions/) on Aseprite's website tells you how to install extensions.

Enjoy!
